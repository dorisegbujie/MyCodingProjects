Welcome to my collection of coding projects! This repository includes various Java projects I've worked on as part of my learning journey. Below is a brief description of each project:

## 1. LightEmAll
- A puzzle game where the goal is to light up the entire board. This project focuses on object-oriented programming and recursion.

## 2. Minesweeper
- A classic Minesweeper game implementation in Java. It features a simple text-based UI and includes basic game mechanics like flagging and uncovering cells.
